## ASP.NET Web API

ASP.NET makes it easy to build services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. With ASP.NET you use the same framework and patterns to build both web pages and services, side-by-side in the same project.

## Angular

Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop.

### Web Interface

The web interface was made on the open source project [ngx-admin](https://akveo.github.io/ngx-admin/).
